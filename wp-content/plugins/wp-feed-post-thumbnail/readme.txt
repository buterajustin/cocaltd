Adds MRSS namespace to the feed and uses post-thumbnail as media element in the feed. Settings available under Settings -> Reading.

## Description ##

With this plugin, an MRSS namespace is added to the site’s RSS feed to include each post’s thumbnail.

WP Feed Post Thumbnail is very lightweight and only adds two small options under Settings -> Reading.

## Installation ##

### Manual Installation ###

1. Upload the entire `/wp-feed-post-thumbnail` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate WP Feed Post Thumbnail through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Enjoy more awesome RSS feeds

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Does the RSS feed still validate with this plugin enabled? ##

Yep, we add the proper XML namespaces for that. Everything just works as expected!

### Any way to force the plugin to always add a certain thumbnail size? ###

Yes. The plugin has two filters available for this:

	// Filters the size on media:content tag. Defaults to 'full'.
	add_filter( 'wp_feed_post_thumbnail_image_size_full', function( $size ) {
		return 'large'; // Return any registered image size.
	}, 10, 1 );
	
	// Filters the size on the media:thumbnail tag. Defaults to 'thumbnail'.
	add_filter( 'wp_feed_post_thumbnail_image_size_thumbnail', function( $size ) {
		return 'medium'; // Return any registered image size.
	}, 10, 1 );
